    * 2023-08-19: Ver 0.9.9 - Luca - Branch: "lab" ---> "master"
      - Implements Network (Relay Race) functionality:
        - Works as usual in Standalone mode
        - Works with NetworkClient [0.9.8] (Relay Race)
      - Demo mode now force a temporary [Autostart] mode when active
      - Added [olr-settings.h] file containing Compile-time settings
        - PIN_LED, PIN_AUDIO, etc

    * 2023-07-20: Ver 0.9.8 - Luca - Branch: "lab"
      - Added "Demo" mode:
        - When Board has [demo_mode=ON] in the EEPROM configuration,
          it plays a "Simulated" race where cars run without any real player. 
          Useful to test the code and to get people attention in Fairs, etc
          On user activity (somebody uses the controllers) the boards jumps 
          back automatically to demo=off mode (Users play races via Controllers)
      - Start implementing Relay Race funcionality 

    * 2023-07-10: Ver 0.9.7 - Lab ---> Master
      - Branch Lab merged to Master 

    * 2021-11-20: Ver 0.9.7 - Luca - Branch: "lab"  
      - Changed Version Number to 0.9.7 
	  	- ready to merge with master branch
		- ver 0.9.7 managed by companion desktopApp

    * 2021-07-20: Ver 0.9.6 - Luca - Branch: "lab"  
      - Manage config parameters (load/save/protocol) for:
         - NEW: Autostart ("G")
         - NEW: Battery ("E")
         - NEW: Players number ("P")
         - UPD: "Q" ("Get configuration" output changed) 
		 		-- Not compatible with previous versions
         - UPD: "~" ---> "*" (Commmand ID for "Leave configuration mode" changed)

    * 2021-07-13: Ver 0.9.6 - Gerardo - Branch: "lab" 
      - Charge  battery function and telemetry test code (add BATTERY ( ",<0-100 value>  to end of "p" serial status ))
      - Add BATTERY_DELTA variable for decremet battery on push buton flag change
      - Add BATTERY_MIN  for user warning on low battery status
      - Add blink efect on min battery condition 
      - Quit tail lap efect
      - Add coin to main track for BATTERY_MODE=1

     * 2020-12-17: Ver 0.9.6- Luca // Gitlab Commit = 0.9.6a
       - Removed dependency from "AsyncSerialLib"
         - new class SerialCommand()
       - Remove delay() (blocking) in Countdown phase 
         - new class SoftTimer()
       - adapted to Serial Protocol 1.0
         - added serial command "@" - Enter Configuration Mode 
           (still respond to deprecated R0,R1 to enter cfg mode)
         - added serial command "K" - Set Physics parameters (weight, friction)
         - added serial command "W" - Write parameter set to EEPROM
         - updated command "B" (Pitlane cfg) to manage PERM parameter
         - updated command "A" (Slope cfg) to manage PERM parameter

    * 2020-08-26: Ver 0.9.5 - Luca 
       - Version number format changed (3 dot-separated integers) !!! 
       - added serial command Get Software ID
       - added serial command Get Software Version

    * 2020-07-28: Ver 0.9.d - Luca 
       - Tested OK on Arduino Every
       - Configuration Values NOW SAVED in EEPROM to enable 
         OLR Configuration via a Software client running on a computer.
         - Laps (Single Race duration)
         - Led Number in the Racetrack (MAXLED)
         - Box Length 
         - Ramp: init,center,end,high
         The User Interface running on the Computer is currently under development.
         Advanced users can already change Cfg Values via Serial (See Protocol documentation)
         Function Activation:
            Even if you can configure Box and Slope parameters, the activation is 
            still managed by user via Controls

       - Winner Visual effect changed (too long for 1200 MAXLED)


    * 2020-07-16: Ver 0.9.c - Luca
       - Changes in [I/O Pin]<>[Car Color] association to match
         the desired Phisical Buttons Layout (Quick Start Guide)
       - Box/Pitlane
         - Entry/exit point marked to help put in place led strip (circuit shape)
         - Coin "Boost" scaled up to make "catch it" worth (almost always win the race)
       - Minor bugfix:
         - box_init(), box_isactive() use wrong var "rampactive"
 
    * 2020-07-16: Ver 0.9.b - Gerardo
       - Sound FX added  

    * 2019-10-10 - Ver 0.9.a
       -First public Version by Angel Maldonado (Maker Faire Roma 2019)
